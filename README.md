# Neural-Trajectory AI for BCI & HMI in Industry 4.0

## Overview
This project integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **3D trajectory prediction** to enhance **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)** and **Human-Machine Interaction (HMI)** systems in **Industry 4.0**. It introduces a novel framework combining the **Industrial Neural Dynamics Framework (INDF)** and the **Adaptive Optimization Strategy for Smart Systems (AOSS)** to address challenges such as dynamic environments, data heterogeneity, real-time processing, and interpretability.

## Key Features
- **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs)** for complex system modeling.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration Modules** to enhance adaptability and coordination.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for predictive decision-making.
- **Adaptive Optimization (AOSS)** embedding domain-specific constraints.
- **Uncertainty Modeling and Attention Mechanisms** for robustness and interpretability.
- **Real-time solutions** for **predictive maintenance, resource allocation, and adaptive control**.

## Framework Components
### 1. Industrial Neural Dynamics Framework (INDF)
- Captures spatio-temporal dependencies in interconnected systems.
- Uses **graph-based learning** and **multi-agent reinforcement learning**.
- Enables adaptive and predictive decision-making.

### 2. Adaptive Optimization Strategy for Smart Systems (AOSS)
- Incorporates **domain constraints** and **uncertainty modeling**.
- Embeds **attention mechanisms** for improved interpretability.
- Ensures compliance with **industrial standards** and **real-time constraints**.

## Applications
This framework enhances various **Industry 4.0** applications:
- **BCI-Enhanced Industrial Automation**
- **Human-Robot Collaboration**
- **Predictive Maintenance**
- **Adaptive Resource Allocation**
- **Intelligent Process Control**
